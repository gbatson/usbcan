README for USBCAN
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This project aims to create an open-source USB-CAN adapter
which works with the Linux SocketCAN infrastructure.

Currently only the first hardware prototype has been 
designed, based on the STM32F105RC device for a direct
implementation in contrast to the number of FT232 based
designs out there.

Firmware development will proceed when the prototypes have
been build, but the first step will be USB support for this
device in libopenstm32.
